# Secure Rails with Hakiri

Hakiri is a command line interface (CLI) for the Hakiri platform. It allows Ruby on Rails developers to automate version scraping of Ruby gems, servers, databases and other technologies used in their stacks. For each technology Hakiri shows CVE vulnerabilities. Here is a snippet of how it works:

~~~
$ hakiri system:scan
-----> Scanning system for software versions...
       Found Ruby 1.9.3.429
       Found Ruby on Rails 3.2.11
-----> Searching for vulnerabilities...
       Found 17 vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails 3.2.11
Show all of them? (yes or no)

CVE-2013-0276
ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.17, 3.1.x before 3.1.11, and 3.2.x before 3.2.12 allows remote attackers to bypass the attr_protected protection mechanism and modify protected model attributes via a crafted request.

...
~~~

Wanna try it on your system?

## Installation

Hakiri CLI is a Ruby gem that can be installed by

~~~
$ gem install hakiri
~~~

After it's installed, restart your command line and you should be good to go. Hakiri supports Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.x and 2.0.x.

## Test Your System in 2 Minutes

Once you have Hakiri CLI installed, it's really easy to start using it. You can scan your Rails stack in a matter of seconds.

One way to do so is to run a command line wizard that will ask you about your technologies in 5 steps:

~~~
$ hakiri system:steps
~~~

After you are done, Hakiri CLI will scrape versions of technologies in your stack and show you all active CVE vulnerabilities.

The wizard is a good way to get a taste of Hakiri but it's not really useful for real work. A much better setup suitable for production is a manifest file that the user can configure with technologies that are part of the stack and then run tests against it.

Hakiri CLI can generate a generic manifest file with the following command:

~~~
$ hakiri manifest:generate
~~~

This will generate a `manifest.json` file in your current directory. It will contain all technologies supported by Hakiri. You can choose which ones you need by editing this file.

Once you are done, run the following command in the directory where you've created the manifest file:

~~~
$ hakiri system:scan
~~~

It will attempt to scrape versions of technologies in your current directory and then make a request to the Hakiri API to see if there are open CVE vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities are found, Hakiri CLI will ask you whether you want to see all of them. The output will look something like this:

~~~
-----> Scanning system for software versions...
       Found Ruby 1.9.3.429
       Found Ruby on Rails 3.2.11
       Found Unicorn 4.6.3
-----> Searching for vulnerabilities...
       Found 17 vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails 3.2.11
Show all of them? (yes or no) yes

CVE-2013-0276
ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.17, 3.1.x before 3.1.11, and 3.2.x before 3.2.12 allows remote attackers to bypass the attr_protected protection mechanism and modify protected model attributes via a crafted request.

...
~~~

Simple, right? If you manifest file is in a different directory or named differently you can specify it in a parameter:

~~~
$ hakiri system:scan -m ../my_stack.json
~~~

You can learn more about configuring the manifest in [Hakiri docs](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/manifest-file).

## Test Your Gemfile

Hakiri supports vulnerability detection for a collection of gems listed in [the docs](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/supported-gems). To scan a `Gemfile.lock` for vulnerabilities in the current directory do the following:

~~~
$ hakiri gemfile:scan
~~~

To scan a specific `Gemfile.lock` add the `-g` parameter at the end:

~~~
$ hakiri gemfile:scan -g ../Gemfile.lock
~~~

This will scan your `Gemfile.lock` and check with the server whether it has any vulnerable gems. It only checks gems that are [supported by Hakiri](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/manifest-file).

You can also [sync your gems](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/syncing-with-the-cloud) with the cloud and get notified when new vulnerabilities come out.

## Advanced Usage

We just went through the most basic Hakiri use case. Here are links to docs describing how to do more:

- [Learn about](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/manifest-file) advanced manifest file options.
- [Setup your](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/authentication-token) authentication token.
- [Sync your technologies and gems](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/syncing-with-the-cloud) with the cloud and get notified when new vulnerabilities come out.
- [Check out technologies](https://www.hakiriup.com/docs/technologies-version-formats) the list of supported technologies and version formats.
